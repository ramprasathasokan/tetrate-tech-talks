# I'm your host, Eitan Suez

I work at Tetrate, and I like to talk tech.

A little bit about myself and my background..
I've spent a lot of time in the last few years doing a lot of technical explaining:
  technical education, training, in-person, online, conference training, and more.

My background has a long tail so to speak, I started out as an electrical engineer turned systems analyst.
An abbreviated history.. was gung ho about the web in the years when netscape announced its browser.
Did a lot of Java and Javascript, startups in the late 90's and early 2000's, user group community stuff, conference speaking, Groovy, Spring, consulting, to education.  Moved from dev to ops with cloud foundry and bosh, then to kubernetes and now to all things service mesh.
You'll have plenty of opportunity to get to know me in this and upcoming episodes!
