## Our guest: [Aditya Prerepa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-prerepa-963007178/), Tetrate

Aditya Prerepa is a talented Tetrate engineer and Istio maintainer.  Aditya is entering his first year of university in the Fall of 2022.  You are invited to watch a [past Istio Weekly episode](https://youtu.be/o3Fi6nwuuiI) where Aditya recounts "how I started contributing to Istio and Envoy."

## Our episode: Learn Istio from the Inside: part 2

On July 1 2022 we recorded the first episode on the subject of [Learning Istio from the Inside](../../episode13/), in which we demonstrated how to build and run Istio locally, and how to configure one's workstation with the Istio codebase for development.

In this episode, we continue the Journey with our guest, Aditya Prerepa, who demonstrates working with the Istio codebase.

Aditya has [previously spoken](https://youtu.be/o3Fi6nwuuiI) about the effectiveness of learning Istio by studying the code and its automated tests, as opposed to the more traditional method of reading a project's reference documentation.  We thought we'd ask Aditya to "show us how it's done."

## Upcoming Episodes

We have the idea of conducting a third installment in this series of "Learning Istio from the Inside".
The plan is to "move up" from learning how to navigate the codebase, to focusing on automated tests as a mechanism for learning the code and how it behaves.

In this upcoming Fall 2022 season, we plan to lower the frequency of our Tech Talk episodes as we focus on some important projects that we will hopefully share with you upon completion.

Stay tuned to this tech talks web site and our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/tetrate) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tetrate) channels for information and updates regarding upcoming episodes.
