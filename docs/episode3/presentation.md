# Istio Certification

- [Certified Istio Administrator](https://academy.tetrate.io/courses/certified-istio-administrator)

    If you already obtained your Kubernetes certifications, the next logical step is Istio certification.
    When you're ready, we have the certification exam available for you to take.
