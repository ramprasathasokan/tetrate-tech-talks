## Topic:  Learning Istio from the inside

Way back in [Istio Weekly episode 12](https://youtu.be/o3Fi6nwuuiI), our guest [Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-prerepa-963007178/) suggested learning Istio less from the documentation and more by studying the source code and its automated tests.

In this episode, we explore that avenue.  The first half of the episode will explore setting up a workstation for local development with Istio.  In the second part, we explore and study a small sliver of the codebase and its unit tests.

See you there!
