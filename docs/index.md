Welcome to Tetrate Tech Talks, a weekly livestream where we feature a conversation with a guest to discuss technology, technical demonstrations and more.

Tetrate is the service mesh company.  Much of our focus is on service meshes, Istio, Envoy, Kubernetes and more.  But we won't shy away from topics that are further afield.  There's plenty to talk about!

Our first episode is scheduled for April 1 2022.

Stay tuned as we line up guests and topics in the coming weeks!
